==========================Summary==========================

This project utilizes machine learning alogrithms such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Bayes Naive to classify text blocks as either spam or not. The Bayes Naive and Logistics Regression uses text processing and vectorization to extract features from input text that are used in the classification alogithms. Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree uses the counts of key words to classify if a text block is spam or not. This program will create four different trained models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Bayes Naive) to tell if a email is spam or not with 90% accuracy.

==========================Set-Up==========================
1. Download Spam_Mail_Classifier repository 
2. Find the file path with your machine using CMD, (C:\Users\Computer\Documents\Python Projects\Spam Email Classifier)
3. Import or write your text in Email_Example.txt to test if the following text is spam or not
4. Run RunSpamEmail.py < Email_Example.txt within your console
5. See Results!
